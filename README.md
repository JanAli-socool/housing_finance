# Loan Project

This Python project calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration.

## Overview

The project consists of two main files:

- `main.py`: Contains the `Loan` class with a method to calculate the monthly payment.
- `test_main.py`: Includes test cases for validating the correctness of the `calculate_monthly_payment` method.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-project.git
   cd loan-project

2. Example for virtual environment

   Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   
   python -m venv loan_venv
   source loan_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'loan_venv\Scripts\activate'
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:

      ```bash
      
      python main.py

4. Testing

      Run the test cases to ensure the correctness of the loan calculation method:
      ```bash
      
      pytest test_main.py

## Usage

   Modify the main.py file or use the provided Loan class in your own projects to calculate loan payments programmatically.
